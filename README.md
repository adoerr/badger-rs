Experiment with and explore USB device emulation in Rust.

This project is inspired and influenced by the current iteration of [FaceDancer](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/facedancer)
and the original [GoodFET](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodfet) based FaceDancer.

For more information on the original Facedancer project,  see
- [Travis Goodspeed's blog post on FaceDancer](http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2012/07/emulating-usb-devices-with-python.html)
- [The FaceDancer 21, the original supported board](http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/facedancer21/)
<br>

The basic idea of `squirrel-rs` is to evaluate if it is possible to achieve FaceDancer's functionality using a 
[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) board and Rust.
